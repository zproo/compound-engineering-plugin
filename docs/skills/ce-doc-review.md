# `ce-doc-review`

> Review requirements or plan documents using parallel persona agents that surface role-specific issues.

`ce-doc-review` is the **document review** skill — sibling to `/ce-code-review` for the docs side of the chain. It analyzes a requirements-only unified plan, implementation-ready plan, or legacy document, selects reviewer personas based on what the doc contains (product framing, design surfaces, security implications, scope sprawl), dispatches them in parallel, then auto-applies safe markdown fixes and routes the rest through a structured four-option interaction (per-finding walk-through, auto-resolve with best judgment, append to Open Questions, report-only).

The compound-engineering ideation chain is `/ce-ideate → /ce-brainstorm → /ce-plan → /ce-work`. `ce-doc-review` is the **review skill for the artifacts produced by `ce-brainstorm` and `ce-plan`** — invoked at their respective Phase 4 / Phase 5.3.8 handoffs, and also directly when you want a structured review of a doc on disk.

## TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What does it do? | Selects reviewer personas based on doc content, dispatches them in parallel, applies `safe_auto` fixes, routes remaining findings through structured interaction |
| When to use it | After `ce-brainstorm` produces a requirements-only unified plan; after `ce-plan` writes or enriches a plan; before handing an implementation-ready plan to execution |
| What it produces | An updated markdown doc with `safe_auto` fixes applied, plus structured handling of `gated_auto` / `manual` findings; HTML unified plans are report-only/skipped until HTML-safe mutation exists |
| Modes | Interactive (direct invocation), Headless (default when chained from `/ce-plan`) |

## The Problem

Document review is harder than code review in specific ways:

- **No type checker** — there's no compiler error when a requirements doc has internal contradictions
- **No execution** — you can't "run" a plan to see if its scope fits its goals
- **Generalist review collapses** — "looks good" misses the design gap, the security implication, the unstated scope expansion
- **Interleaved concerns** — product framing, security, design, scope, and feasibility all need different lenses, but a single reviewer prioritizes one
- **Findings lack ownership** — "consider revising" without saying who decides or what to do
- **Rejected findings re-surface** — the same issue gets flagged round after round because the rejection wasn't recorded

## The Solution

`ce-doc-review` runs document review as a structured pipeline with explicit gates:

- **Always-on personas** for coherence and feasibility
- **Conditional personas** selected based on doc content — product-lens, design-lens, security-lens, scope-guardian, adversarial
- **Parallel persona dispatch** with bounded concurrency
- **Synthesis pipeline** with cross-persona agreement promotion, contradiction resolution, and three-tier routing (`safe_auto`, `gated_auto`, `manual` + FYI)
- **Decision primer** — round-to-round suppression so rejected findings don't re-surface and applied findings get verification
- **Four-option interaction** — per-finding walk-through, auto-resolve with best judgment, append to Open Questions, report-only

## What Makes It Novel

### 1. Doc-content-aware persona selection

Conditional personas activate based on what the doc actually says, not keyword matching:

- **`product-lens-reviewer`** — when the doc makes challengeable claims about what to build and why, or when the proposed work carries strategic weight (trajectory, identity, adoption, opportunity cost)
- **`design-lens-reviewer`** — when the doc contains UI/UX references, user flows, interaction descriptions, or visual design language
- **`security-lens-reviewer`** — when the doc touches auth, public APIs, data handling, PII, payments, third-party trust boundaries
- **`scope-guardian-reviewer`** — when the doc has multiple priority tiers, large requirement counts, or scope-boundary language that seems misaligned
- **`adversarial-document-reviewer`** — when the doc touches high-stakes domains (auth, payments, migrations), proposes new abstractions, has missing or extended origin, contains requirements-shape premise content, or presents explicit alternatives

The 2 always-on (`coherence-reviewer`, `feasibility-reviewer`) run on every review. Conditional personas add depth where the doc's content warrants it.

Personas also **scope their techniques by doc shape**. On plan-shape docs with validated upstream Product Contract provenance — legacy `Origin:` requirements docs, `product_contract_source: ce-brainstorm`, or `product_contract_source: legacy-requirements` — `product-lens-reviewer`, `adversarial-document-reviewer`, and `scope-guardian-reviewer` suppress their premise-level techniques and run only implementation-level checks (technical assumptions, decision stress-testing, architectural alternatives, deferred-work scope creep). On requirements-shape docs they run their full technique set. `feasibility-reviewer` inverts: shadow-path tracing, implementability, and migration mechanics are scoped to plan-shape docs; on requirements docs it runs a tight "would this direction force a fundamental rework?" check. Doc-type classification happens once in the orchestrator (readiness metadata, content-shape signals, frontmatter, R-IDs vs U-IDs, section structure) and the result is passed to every persona. Unified artifacts are sliced: requirements-only plans review the Product Contract, while implementation-ready plans review Product Contract, Planning Contract, Implementation Units, Verification Contract, and Definition of Done without sending the whole artifact to every reviewer by default.

### 2. Synthesis pipeline with three-tier routing

After all personas return, synthesis:

- Validates each finding against the schema
- Applies an anchor-based gate (drops findings that don't anchor to actual doc content)
- Deduplicates across personas
- **Promotes findings on cross-persona agreement** — two reviewers spotting the same issue raises priority
- Resolves contradictions (different personas disagree on what to do)
- Auto-promotes safe-auto candidates that meet the bar
- Routes findings into three tiers — `safe_auto` (applied directly), `gated_auto` / `manual` (user decision), and FYI (advisory only)

The output is one consolidated set, not a flat list of every persona's raw output.

### 3. Decision primer — round-to-round suppression

When the user runs multiple rounds in the same session (apply some findings, leave the rest, run again), the decision primer carries forward what was applied vs rejected:

- **Applied findings** flow back so round-N+1 personas can verify the fix actually landed
- **Rejected findings** (skip / defer / acknowledge) are suppressed via fingerprint + evidence-substring overlap matching, so the same issue doesn't re-surface

The primer uses an evidence-snippet (first ~120 chars of each finding's evidence) for the overlap test, beyond just title fingerprinting. Without the snippet, suppression falls back to title-only and either re-surfaces rejected findings or suppresses too aggressively.

### 4. Four-option interaction model

When findings land in `gated_auto` / `manual` tiers, the user picks how to handle them:

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Per-finding walk-through | Step through each finding individually; apply, skip, defer to Open Questions, or acknowledge |
| Auto-resolve with best judgment | Skill applies what it judges safe; user reviews bulk preview before committing |
| Append to Open Questions | All findings deferred to the doc's `## Open Questions` section as a batch |
| Report-only | No edits; report stays in chat |

The walk-through itself supports an "auto-resolve the rest" escape mid-flow if the user has reviewed enough to trust the rest.

### 5. Bulk-action preview before mass changes

When the user picks "Auto-resolve with best judgment" or "Append to Open Questions" — or escapes mid walk-through to "Auto-resolve the rest" — the skill shows a preview of every change before applying. The preview includes the section, finding title, action (apply / skip / defer / acknowledge), and brief rationale. The user confirms or cancels. This is the safety valve for bulk operations: the user sees what's about to land before it does.

### 6. Two modes — Interactive and Headless

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **Interactive** | Direct user invocation, or opt-in via `Run deeper doc review` from a caller's post-generation menu | Routing question, per-finding walk-through, bulk-preview confirmations |
| **Headless** _(default for chained invocation)_ | `mode:headless`; default at `/ce-plan` Phase 5.3.8 | Apply `safe_auto` silently; return all other findings as structured text; surface a one-line summary above the caller's next menu; no prompts |

Headless is the default for chained invocation from doc-producing skills — `/ce-plan` Phase 5.3.8 invokes it headless so routine plans autofix and surface a summary line without blocking the user. Interactive is for direct invocation, or when the user opts into `Run deeper doc review` from the post-generation menu.

### 7. Bounded parallelism with backpressure

Persona dispatch respects the harness's active-subagent limit. Selected reviewers queue; the skill dispatches as many as the harness accepts and fills freed slots as reviewers complete. Active-agent / concurrency-limit spawn errors are treated as backpressure (retry after a slot frees), not as reviewer failure. Reviewers are recorded as failed only when a successful dispatch times out or fails for a non-capacity reason.

### 8. Coverage transparency

The output names which personas ran, which were activated by what signals, and whether any failed or timed out. The user can audit "did the right reviewers actually look at this" without parsing internal state.

### 9. Cross-model judgment pass

The **conditional judgment trio** — `adversarial-document-reviewer`, `product-lens-reviewer`, `security-lens-reviewer` — also runs through **one different model provider than the host**, in a separate read-only process, whenever those lenses activate. These are the lenses whose output diverges most across models — premise falsification, strategic-claim challenge, and threat coverage — so a second, genuinely independent model surfaces findings the host model misses, and agreement between a peer return and its in-process twin is the strongest promotion signal in the synthesis (different model providers, separate processes). The convergent lenses (coherence, scope-guardian) and the always-on feasibility lens stay single-model — feasibility is excluded specifically so the pass stays conditional and doesn't spawn a peer on every review.

Alongside those focused twins, a single **whole-document sweep** has one different-provider peer review the *entire* document as a general reviewer (not lens-scoped), folding in as `whole-doc-<provider>` — so a different model catches blind spots across **every** section (feasibility, coherence, scope), not just the trio's premise lenses. It's one extra call, corroborating by dedup fingerprint against any in-process finding, so broad coverage comes without a per-lens fan-out. On unified plans the focused trio peers are sliced to review exactly what their in-process twin reviewed (true corroboration), while the sweep deliberately reads the whole document (breadth) — two complementary modes.

**Which provider runs the peer** is auto-chosen and overridable. The skill attests the *host's* own provider only to exclude it (so the pass never self-reviews); if it can't attest the host — e.g. Cursor on an undetectable model — it skips rather than risk a same-provider peer. It then resolves **one** different provider **once per document** by precedence: a preference stated in conversation, then a `cross_model_peer:` key in `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml`, then a preference already in the project's active instructions, then the first available provider by the order `codex → claude → grok → composer`. A provider is reached by its dedicated CLI (`codex`, `claude`, `grok`) or by `cursor-agent` (grok fallback and Composer). All activated lenses run on **one model per provider at high reasoning** (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `opus`, `grok-4.5`, or `composer-2.5-fast` — Composer's `-fast` tier is its ceiling); the concrete IDs live in one in-script mapping. A second provider is opt-in only (`CROSS_MODEL_MAX_PEERS=2`). Each peer runs as a detached, supervised job the review polls in bounded wait slices — no tool call spans the peer's runtime, and a started peer that fails or times out is named in Coverage with its terminal state rather than vanishing. The pass is **non-blocking** — an un-attestable host, no reachable different provider, a missing/unauthenticated CLI, or a timeout skips silently and the review completes exactly as it would single-model. It runs in both interactive and headless modes: interactive announces it as an **independent cross-model review**, names the requested model (and the `cursor-agent` route when that's how a model is reached, so Grok-via-cursor-agent vs Composer is unambiguous), **and states that full document content is sent to that provider**; headless stays user-silent but still emits an audit log of the egress. The report records requested-vs-served model identity: on routes without a served-model receipt the model is labeled "requested, unverified" rather than asserted.

**Trust boundary:** the pass embeds the full document content into the peer prompt and sends it to an external model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, or Cursor, depending on the resolved peer); `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS` restricts which providers may receive content (unset = default order; set = allowlist). The peer runs strictly read-only, from an empty scratch dir with no project context — every route denies writes, network, MCP, and subagents. On **reads**, the routes are two tiers: **truly tool-less** — claude (`--bare --tools ""`, all built-ins disabled, no CLAUDE.md/MCP auto-discovery) and grok (denies `Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/`Bash`/`Task`/web/`mcp__*`), with no read tool at all; and **read-only residual** — codex (`-s read-only`) and cursor-agent (`--mode ask --sandbox enabled`), which still permit a read tool (codex also read-only shell exec). So impact is bounded to disclosure rather than repo mutation, and the script emits a one-line audit log of each cross-model send so the egress is auditable even in headless mode. Peer prompts use basename-only document paths (content is already embedded). Over-size documents skip cleanly rather than truncating. The read residual on the codex/cursor-agent routes is **accepted** for the own-document threat model: the reviewed doc is the maintainer's own, and the host agent already runs in-repo with more privilege than any peer, so a peer that can read a file adds no material exposure.

### 10. Settled-decision protection

Decisions the user examined and settled carry a `session-settled:` annotation, and `ce-doc-review` treats it as protected content: the safe-auto pass never strips it, and a persona that wants to challenge a settled decision must frame the challenge as infeasibility, not preference — surfaced for decision, never auto-applied.

## Quick Example

`/ce-plan` finishes producing a Standard plan for a notification-mute feature. Phase 5.3.8 invokes `/ce-doc-review` in `mode:headless` with the plan path.

The skill reads the doc, classifies it as `plan` from content-shape signals (U-IDs, plan section structure), reads the `Origin:` slot, and analyzes content for conditional personas. The plan touches a UI surface (mute toggle copy) but no high-stakes domains and proposes no new abstractions. It activates `coherence-reviewer` (always-on), `feasibility-reviewer` (always-on, scoped to plan-shape techniques), and `design-lens-reviewer` (UI surface). Adversarial, scope-guardian, security-lens, and product-lens skip — none of their triggers fire on a routine plan with origin set.

Three reviewers dispatch in parallel. They return 9 raw findings. Synthesis merges them into 6 distinct findings: 2 `safe_auto` (typo, broken cross-reference), 3 `gated_auto` (wording on the durability tradeoff, missing edge case in test scenarios for U2, design-lens flag on the toggle copy), 1 FYI (suggested scope clarification).

The 2 `safe_auto` apply directly. Headless mode returns the rest as structured text — no walkthrough, no per-finding routing. A single summary line surfaces above the post-generation menu: `Doc review applied 2 fixes. 3 decisions, 1 FYI remain.` The user picks `Start /ce-work` and goes. Had they wanted to address the 3 decisions interactively, they'd have picked `Run deeper doc review` instead.

## When to Reach For It

Reach for `ce-doc-review` when:

- A requirements-only unified plan just landed from `/ce-brainstorm` and you want a structured Product Contract review before planning
- A plan just landed from `/ce-plan` and you want a deeper review before execution
- You're in headless mode and a programmatic caller (the chain skills) needs review with structured output
- You want round-to-round refinement on a doc — the decision primer prevents loops

Skip `ce-doc-review` when:

- The doc is trivially short (a 2-bullet plan; review overhead exceeds yield)
- You want code review, not doc review → `/ce-code-review`
- The doc is purely informational (a learning doc, a release note) — there's nothing to "review for shipping"

---

## Use as Part of the Workflow

`ce-doc-review` is invoked from doc-producing skills as their review pass:

- **`/ce-brainstorm` Phase 4** — offered as one of the post-doc options ("Agent review of Product Contract"); runs interactive with full premise scrutiny, since validating premise is exactly what brainstorm exists for
- **`/ce-plan` Phase 5.3.8** — runs in `mode:headless` by default after the confidence check. `safe_auto` fixes apply silently; remaining findings surface as a one-line summary above the post-generation menu, where `Run deeper doc review` is exposed as a first-class option for users who want the interactive walkthrough
- **`/ce-resolve-pr-feedback`** — when reviewer feedback lands on a brainstorm or plan doc rather than code

In headless mode, callers receive structured findings and route the user-decision options themselves.

---

## Use Standalone

The skill works directly on unified plan artifacts, legacy requirements docs, and plan docs:

- **Specific path** — `/ce-doc-review docs/plans/2026-05-04-001-feat-notification-mute-plan.md`
- **Ask the user** — `/ce-doc-review` with no path asks which doc to review (or auto-finds the most recent in `docs/brainstorms/` or `docs/plans/`)
- **Headless** — `/ce-doc-review mode:headless docs/plans/.../plan.md` returns structured findings without interactive prompts

---

## Reference

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| _(empty, interactive)_ | Asks which doc to review or auto-finds the most recent |
| `<doc path>` | Reviews that specific doc |
| `mode:headless <doc path>` | Headless mode; structured text output, no prompts |

Headless mode requires a path; without one it errors out rather than guessing.

## FAQ

**What's the difference between this and `ce-code-review`?**
`ce-code-review` reviews diffs (code changes); `ce-doc-review` reviews docs (requirements, plans). Different reviewer personas, different findings shape, different routing. Both share the multi-persona dispatch + synthesis pattern, and both run a **cross-model pass** with the same provider-selection mechanics (host attestation, preference order, codex/claude/grok/composer routes). Lens policy differs: `ce-code-review` runs its single adversarial lens cross-model; `ce-doc-review` runs the three-lens judgment trio (adversarial, product-lens, security-lens) plus a whole-doc sweep, because doc-review's high-value judgment is spread across more lenses.

**Which lenses run cross-model, and why not all of them?**
Only the judgment trio — adversarial, product-lens, security-lens — get a dedicated cross-model *twin*, because those are where a second model's different priors and knowledge produce genuinely different findings, so agreement carries real signal. Coherence and scope-guardian are convergent (a second model just echoes them), and feasibility is always-on, so giving each its own twin would spawn a peer on every review rather than only on documents that warrant deeper scrutiny. Those areas aren't left uncovered, though: the separate whole-document sweep (above) still gives feasibility, coherence, and scope broad cross-model coverage — it just does so through one general-reviewer read rather than a per-lens twin.

**Why does the decision primer matter?**
Without it, every round re-surfaces the same findings, including ones the user already rejected. The primer uses fingerprint + evidence-snippet matching to suppress rejected findings and verify applied fixes — making round-to-round refinement actually iterate, not loop.

**What's "Append to Open Questions" for?**
For findings the user wants to address later, not now. Rather than losing them in chat, they get appended to the doc's `## Open Questions` section so they survive the session and the next planner / implementer sees them.

**Why does it have a bulk preview?**
Because mass changes deserve a confirmation step. "Auto-resolve with best judgment" feels like delegation, but if the skill silently applies 12 changes you can't review without a preview, that's a risk. The preview shows the changes before commit so the user can cancel.

**What if a persona times out or fails?**
The skill proceeds with findings from agents that completed and notes the failure in the Coverage section. A single agent failure doesn't block the entire review.

**Can it review documents other than requirements and plans?**
The personas are tuned for those two types specifically. Reviewing a learning doc or release note works mechanically but the persona advice may not be calibrated for that artifact type. For broad doc review, this is the right tool; for specific other types, the personas may surface noise.
