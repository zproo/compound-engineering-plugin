# Research agent dispatch is intentionally separated across the skill pipeline

## Context

After optimizing the Slack researcher agent to avoid redundant work between ce-brainstorm and ce-plan (commit f7a14b76 on `tmchow/slack-analyst-agent`), a natural question arose: does the same duplication problem exist for `ce-repo-research-analyst` and `ce-learnings-researcher`? Both are dispatched by ce-plan in Phase 1.1 on every run, regardless of whether ce-brainstorm produced an origin document.

Investigation confirmed no duplication exists. The three workflow stages operate on deliberately separated information types, and research agent dispatch follows this separation cleanly.

## Guidance

The brainstorm -> plan -> work pipeline separates research by information type:

**ce-brainstorm** gathers *product context* (WHAT to build). It performs an inline "Existing Context Scan" -- surface-level file discovery focused on product questions. It does NOT dispatch `ce-repo-research-analyst` or `ce-learnings-researcher`. Its output is a requirements document covering product decisions, scope, and success criteria, intentionally excluding implementation details.

**ce-plan** gathers *implementation context* (HOW to build it). It ALWAYS dispatches `ce-repo-research-analyst` (technology, architecture, patterns) and `ce-learnings-researcher` in Phase 1.1. These produce: tech stack versions, architectural patterns, conventions, file paths, and institutional knowledge from `docs/solutions/`. This feeds the plan document's Context & Research, Patterns to Follow, Files, and Key Technical Decisions sections. The `ce-repo-research-analyst` output also drives Phase 1.2 decisions about whether external research agents are needed.

**ce-work** gathers NO research context independently. It reads the plan document and uses embedded research findings to guide implementation. For bare prompts (no plan), it does a lightweight inline scan -- no agent dispatch. The plan document IS the handoff mechanism from ce-plan's research to ce-work.

When ce-plan receives an origin document from ce-brainstorm, it reads it as primary input (Phase 0.3) but still runs its research agents because they gather categorically different information.

## Why This Matters

- **Prevents false optimizations.** Without understanding the information type separation, a contributor might skip ce-plan's research agents when a brainstorm document exists, breaking the plan's ability to produce implementation-ready guidance.
- **Clarifies when pass-through optimizations ARE warranted.** The Slack researcher was a genuine redundancy: both ce-brainstorm and ce-plan dispatched the same agent for overlapping information. The fix passed existing context so the agent focuses on gaps. For `ce-repo-research-analyst` and `ce-learnings-researcher`, no such redundancy exists because only ce-plan dispatches them.
- **Protects the plan document's role as the sole handoff artifact.** ce-work depends on the plan containing complete implementation context. If ce-plan's research agents are skipped, ce-work receives an incomplete plan and must improvise.

## When to Apply

- When evaluating whether research agent calls across pipeline stages are redundant -- check whether multiple stages dispatch the same agent for overlapping information types.
- When adding a new research agent -- classify whether it gathers product context (brainstorm), implementation context (plan), or execution context (work), and dispatch it from the matching stage only.
- When considering a pass-through optimization like the Slack pattern -- the prerequisite is that TWO stages independently dispatch the same agent. If only one stage dispatches the agent, no optimization is needed.

## Examples

**No optimization needed (this case):**
ce-plan always calls `ce-repo-research-analyst` even when a brainstorm document exists. Does ce-brainstorm also call it? No -- brainstorm only does an inline product-focused scan. The calls are not redundant; no change needed.

**Optimization warranted (Slack pattern):**
Both ce-brainstorm and ce-plan dispatched `ce-slack-researcher`. Fix: when ce-plan finds Slack context in the origin document, pass it to `ce-slack-researcher` so the agent focuses on gaps. The agent is still called -- it starts from a better baseline.

**Anti-pattern -- skipping agents incorrectly:**
Removing `ce-repo-research-analyst` from ce-plan when an origin document exists, reasoning "brainstorm already scanned the repo." The resulting plan lacks architectural patterns, file paths, and convention details. ce-work produces code that ignores existing patterns.

**Correct stage placement for a new agent:**
A "dependency-analyzer" agent that identifies library versions and compatibility constraints gathers implementation context (HOW). It belongs in ce-plan's Phase 1.1, not ce-brainstorm. ce-work will consume its findings via the plan document.
