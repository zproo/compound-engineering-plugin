## Problem

The initial `ce-compound-refresh` skill had several design issues discovered during real-world testing:

1. Interactive questions never triggered the proper tool (AskUserQuestion) because the instruction used a weak "when available" qualifier
2. Auto-delete criteria contradicted a "always ask before deleting" rule in a later phase
3. Broad scope (9+ docs) asked the user to choose an area blindly without providing analysis
4. The Replace flow tried to hand off to `ce-compound`, which expects fresh problem-solving context the user doesn't have months later
5. Subagents used shell commands for file existence checks, triggering permission prompts
6. No way to run the skill unattended (e.g., on a schedule) — every run required user interaction

## Root Cause

Five independent design issues, each with a distinct root cause:

1. **Hardcoded tool name with escape hatch.** Saying "Use AskUserQuestion when available" gave the model permission to skip the tool and just output text. Also non-portable to Codex and other platforms.
2. **Contradictory rules across phases.** Phase 2 defined auto-delete criteria. Phase 3 said "always ask before deleting" with no exception. The model followed Phase 3.
3. **Question before evidence.** The skill prompted scope selection before gathering any information about which areas were most stale or interconnected.
4. **Unsatisfied precondition in cross-skill handoff.** `ce-compound` expects a recently solved problem with fresh context. A maintenance refresh has investigation evidence instead — equivalent data, different shape.
5. **No tool preference guidance for subagents.** Without explicit instruction, subagents defaulted to bash for file operations.
6. **Interactive-only design.** Every phase assumed a user was present. No way to run autonomously for scheduled maintenance or hands-off sweeps.

## Solution

### 1. Platform-agnostic interactive questions

Reference "the platform's interactive question tool" as the concept, with concrete examples:

```markdown
Ask questions **one at a time** — use the platform's interactive question tool
(e.g. `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex) and
**stop to wait for the answer** before continuing.
```

The "stop to wait" language removes the escape hatch. The examples help each platform's model select the right tool.

### 2. Auto-delete exemption for unambiguous cases

Phase 3 now defers to Phase 2's auto-delete criteria:

```markdown
You are about to Delete a document **and** the evidence is not unambiguous
(see auto-delete criteria in Phase 2). When auto-delete criteria are met,
proceed without asking.
```

### 3. Smart triage for broad scope

When 9+ candidate docs are found, triage before asking:

1. **Inventory** — read frontmatter, group by module/component/category
2. **Impact clustering** — dense clusters of interconnected learnings + pattern docs are higher-impact than isolated docs
3. **Spot-check drift** — check whether primary referenced files still exist
4. **Recommend** — present the highest-impact cluster with rationale

Key insight: "code changed recently" is NOT a reliable staleness signal. Missing references in a high-impact cluster is the strongest signal.

### 4. Replacement subagents instead of ce-compound handoff

By the time a Replace is identified, Phase 1 investigation has already gathered the evidence that `ce-compound` would research:
- The old learning's claims
- What the current code actually does
- Where and why the drift occurred

A replacement subagent writes the successor directly using `ce-compound`'s document format (frontmatter, problem, root cause, solution, prevention). Run sequentially — one at a time — because each may read significant code.

When evidence is insufficient (e.g., entire subsystem replaced, new architecture too complex to understand from investigation alone), mark as stale and recommend `ce-compound` after the user's next encounter with that area.

### 5. Dedicated file tools over shell commands

Added to subagent strategy:

```markdown
Subagents should use dedicated file search and read tools for investigation —
not shell commands. This avoids unnecessary permission prompts and is more
reliable across platforms.
```

### 6. Headless mode for scheduled/unattended runs

Added `mode:headless` argument support so the skill can run without user interaction (e.g., on a schedule, in CI, or when the user just wants a hands-off sweep).

Key design decisions:
- **Explicit opt-in only.** `mode:headless` must be in the arguments. Auto-detection based on tool availability was rejected because a user in an interactive agent without a question tool (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf) is still interactive — they just use plain-text replies.
- **Conservative confidence.** Borderline cases that would get a user question in interactive mode get marked stale in headless mode. Err toward stale-marking over incorrect action.
- **Detailed report as deliverable.** Since no user was present, the output report includes full rationale for each action so a human can review after the fact.
- **Process everything.** No scope narrowing questions — if no scope hint provided, process all docs. For broad scope, process clusters in impact order without asking.

## Prevention

### Skill review checklist additions

These five patterns should be checked during any skill review:

1. **No hardcoded tool names** — All tool references use capability-first language with platform examples and a plain-text fallback
2. **No contradictory rules across phases** — Trace each action type through all phases; verify absolute language ("always," "never") is not contradicted elsewhere
3. **No blind user questions** — Every question presented to the user is informed by evidence the agent gathered first
4. **No unsatisfied cross-skill preconditions** — Every skill handoff verifies the target skill's preconditions are met by the calling context
5. **No shell commands for file operations in subagents** — Subagent instructions explicitly prefer dedicated tools over shell commands
6. **Headless mode for long-running skills** — Any skill that could run unattended should support an explicit opt-in mode with conservative confidence and detailed reporting

### Key anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Better pattern |
|---|---|
| "Use the AskUserQuestion tool when available" | "Use the platform's interactive question tool (e.g. AskUserQuestion in Claude Code, request_user_input in Codex)" |
| Defining auto-delete conditions, then "always ask before deleting" | Single-source-of-truth: define the rule once, reference it elsewhere |
| "Which area should we review?" before any investigation | Triage first, recommend with evidence, let user confirm or redirect |
| "Create a successor learning through ce-compound" during a refresh | Replacement subagent writes directly using gathered evidence |
| No tool guidance for subagents | "Use dedicated file search and read tools, not shell commands" |
| Auto-detecting "no question tool = headless" | Explicit `mode:headless` argument — interactive agents without question tools are still interactive |
