# Script-First Skill Architecture

When a skill processes large datasets (session transcripts, log files, configuration inventories), having the model do the processing is a token-expensive anti-pattern. Moving data processing into a bundled script and having the model present the results cuts token usage by 60-75%. (For which language to write that script in, see [prefer-python-over-bash-for-pipeline-scripts](../best-practices/prefer-python-over-bash-for-pipeline-scripts-2026-04-09.md); this doc is about *whether* to offload, not *which language*.)

## Origin

Learned while building the `claude-permissions-optimizer` skill (since retired from the plugin in favor of `/less-permission-prompts`), which analyzed Claude Code session transcripts to find safe Bash commands to auto-allow. Initial iterations had the model reading JSONL session files, classifying commands against a 370-line reference doc, and normalizing patterns -- averaging 85-115k tokens per run. After moving all processing into the extraction script, runs dropped to ~40k tokens with equivalent output quality. The same pattern is live today in `ce-sessions`, whose bundled `extract-metadata.py` / `extract-skeleton.py` scripts do session discovery and classification while the model only presents.

## The Anti-Pattern: Model-as-Processor

The default instinct when building a skill that touches data is to have the model read everything into context, parse it, classify it, and reason about it. This works for small inputs but scales terribly:

- Token usage grows linearly with data volume
- Most tokens are spent on mechanical work (parsing JSON, matching patterns, counting frequencies)
- Loading reference docs for classification rules inflates context further
- The model's actual judgment contributes almost nothing to the classification output

## The Pattern: Script Produces, Model Presents

```
skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md              # Instructions: run script, present output
  scripts/
    process.py          # Does ALL data processing, outputs JSON
```

1. **Script does all mechanical work.** Reading files, parsing structured formats, applying classification rules (regex, keyword lists), normalizing results, computing counts. Outputs pre-classified JSON to stdout.

2. **SKILL.md instructs presentation only.** Run the script, read the JSON, format it for the user. Explicitly prohibit re-classifying, re-parsing, or loading reference files.

3. **Single source of truth for rules.** Classification logic lives exclusively in the script. The SKILL.md references the script's output categories as given facts but does not define them.

## Token Impact

| Approach | Tokens | Reduction |
|---|---|---|
| Model does everything (read, parse, classify, present) | ~100k | baseline |
| Added "do NOT grep session files" instruction | ~84k | 16% |
| Script classifies; model still loads reference doc | ~38k | 62% |
| Script classifies; model presents only | ~35k | 65% |

The biggest single win was moving classification into the script. The second was removing the instruction to load the reference file -- once the script handles classification, the reference file is maintenance documentation only.

## When to Apply

Apply script-first architecture when a skill meets **any** of these:

- Processes more than ~50 items or reads files larger than a few KB
- Classification rules are deterministic (regex, keyword lists, lookup tables)
- Input data follows a consistent schema (JSONL, CSV, structured logs)
- The skill runs frequently or feeds into further analysis

**Do not apply** when:
- The skill's core value is the model's judgment (code review, architectural analysis)
- Input is unstructured natural language
- The dataset is small enough that processing costs are negligible

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Instruction-only optimization.** Adding "don't do X" to SKILL.md without providing a script alternative. The model will find other token-expensive paths to the same result.

- **Hybrid classification.** Having the script classify some items and the model classify the rest. This still loads context and reference docs. Go all-in on the script. Items the script can't classify should be dropped as "unclassified," not handed to the model.

- **Dual rule definitions.** Classification rules in both the script AND the SKILL.md. They drift apart, the model may override the script's decisions, and tokens are wasted on re-evaluation. One source of truth.

## Checklist for Skill Authors

- [ ] Can the data processing be expressed as deterministic logic (regex, keyword matching, field checks)?
- [ ] Script is the single owner of all classification rules
- [ ] SKILL.md instructs the model to run the script as its first action
- [ ] SKILL.md does not restate or duplicate the script's classification logic
- [ ] Script output is structured JSON the model can present directly
- [ ] Reference docs exist for maintainers but are never loaded at runtime
- [ ] After building, verify the model is not doing any mechanical parsing or rule-application work
